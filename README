A few things that may be of use or are useful to know in this context:

* Tuples are always arrays of word (*), so they are convenient for
  passing large numbers of arguments to C-functions. owl/core.scm:452
  has the descriptor format
* Strings with ASCII data are internally char*, but large strings can
  be trees, and strings with higher unicode codepoints are stored in a
  wider format. You can use c-string from (owl string) to convert them
  to null-terminated UTF8 for passing to C if necessary.
* (type <object>) can useful for checking in what format a value is
  stored in heap.
* If an extension function needs to block, it's a good idea to instead
  return a value denoting the need and repeatedly e.g. (sleep 50) at
  lisp side until a result is available. This makes it possible for
  other threads to keep running.
